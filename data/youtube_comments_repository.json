It's very well acted by stellar cast. - Interested in 'Earth' to see how an Alien gets to Earth and we're not wiped out?  'The perfect organism\"?  Obviously not. The 'Woke' mentions bother me though.  It was always a horror house Monster flick ( A SCARY remake of student film DARK STAR ), that somehow slipped into the meaning of life and creation. Big up for inclusion, but I'm hoping Race, gender, faith/belief, and \"People pleasing\" doesn't dilute the original SCARE factor.  Fingers crossed. \"I'll be back\".  BionicKoalaBoy",

Something that worked perfectly for decades has been completely ruined.\nInstead of staying true to what made Alien great — suspense, tension, and genuine horror — they just had to go for another “modern” take. With all the forced “woke” nonsense, annoying kid characters, and ridiculous storylines, it’s simply embarrassing.\n\nThe so-called “security labs” are less secure than a preschool. Every plot point is dumber than the last, and you can’t help but be frustrated the whole time. The idea of hybrid children is absurd and misses everything that made Alien terrifying. With that kind of budget, this could have been incredible — but it’s just a massive failure.\n\nAlien: Earth isn’t scary, isn’t thrilling, and completely misunderstands the essence of Alien.

Probably best viewed on a one episode per weekly schedule, like in the old days, so the patterns aren't so obviously gratuitous, and on a wet winter's Wednesday night, you won't really care.

Officer Harmon, her trainer, is a veteran. Her scars bear witness. She is passionate but flawed. Dutiful but will bend rules. This is communicated in the first episode with the introduction of her new rookie trainee. Officer Diaz is relentless in pursuit of his ambitions and shares the same zeal for the job as her trainer. Officer Harmon doesn't know that, yet. It grabs you the first episode if you can handle the fast pace. All around it's good cop show with a peak window look at a criminal syndicate.",

Generally, cells are locked down from 9-10pm until 6am and then the cells are open during the day and you’re free to use the living area.  High security prisons are 23/1 but that’s because most of the inmates will eat each other lol.",

We have enough of that as it is and that's already one of the hardest challenges to deal with in America and we don't need anything feeding that problem.",

Also with the CO's not allowed in there full time there is probably less stuff being brought in and less people having problems with the CO's because some are just as crooked as the inmate and cause the problems!!

            "You’re absolutely right to question that. A lot of these prison documentaries, especially ones like Unlocked: A Jail Experiment, tend to package familiar setups as if they’re revolutionary. It’s probably a mix of marketing hype and trying to create a narrative arc for viewers who don’t have real experience with jail or prison systems.\n\nThe “experiment” part often boils down to tone, not actual structure. For example, in that Arkansas setup, the media might be hyping up the idea that guards are less hands-on and inmates are given more “freedom” or self-governance—but to someone who’s been inside, it just looks like regular day-to-day pod life. You’re still locked in, still around the same people 24/7, still following a rigid schedule.\n\nThey act like it’s a privilege because, to outsiders, the idea of inmates being “trusted” to manage themselves sounds radical. But in reality, inmates already do that by necessity. The guards often aren’t involved unless there’s a problem—they aren’t babysitting.\n\nIt’s like they’re repackaging something you’ve lived through and calling it innovation for the sake of storytelling and ratings.\n\nDid anything in the show actually strike you as new or different, or did it all seem like same old, same old to you?",

How does another inmate make it his business to police another inmate on him disrespecting a deputy which he did not do until she pressed the issue, but even if he did and you felt some type of way about you wait and pull that man to the side, those are the rules if you genuinely felt some type of way about it.

Trevor Bingley leaves a baby unattended in a luxury penthouse, hides it in bags and cupboards, drags it through public spaces, and nothing ever has believable consequences. In one episode he uses designer scarves and random household items as makeshift baby gear, played as “comedy” despite being absurd and nonsensical. Entire sequences rely on instant escalation: minor mishaps turn into full-scale destruction within seconds, clearly driven by editing and sound effects rather than cause and effect. The baby itself feels uncanny, more like an AI-assisted prop than a real infant, with stiff reactions and a Chucky-like presence that pulls you out of every scene. Acting is broad and lazy, production feels bargain-basement, and every gag is visible minutes in advance. Many viewers describe the same experience: irritating, repetitive, and exhausting rather than funny. Compared to classic Mr. Bean, where physical comedy had timing, realism and precision, this feels like a hollow, low-effort imitation that mistakes chaos for humor and noise for jokes."

            "War Between Land and Sea goes heavy on concept before execution. The idea itself is epic—two worlds colliding, power struggles, survival, and domination—but the delivery feels uneven. Visually, it tries to be grand with battle scenes and dramatic settings, and some moments genuinely hit hard, especially when the conflict escalates.",
            "The War Between the Land and the Sea feels less like a loud blockbuster and more like a slow, reflective story about conflict and consequences. The movie is built around the idea of humans pushing nature too far, and it uses the struggle between land and sea as a powerful symbol. From the beginning, there’s a heavy, serious tone that lets you know this isn’t just about destruction—it’s about choices, responsibility, and what happens when balance is lost.\n\nWhat really stands out is the mood. The film takes its time, using visuals and quiet moments to create tension rather than nonstop action. The contrast between the sea and the land is striking, and it often feels like nature itself is a character in the story. Some scenes hit emotionally, especially when characters are forced to face the consequences of their actions, though a few moments feel dragged out or emotionally distant.\n\nIn the end, The War Between the Land and the Sea is the kind of movie that stays with you more for its message than its plot. It’s not perfect, and it won’t appeal to everyone, especially if you prefer fast-paced stories. But if you like thoughtful films that make you reflect on humanity’s relationship with nature, this one delivers a quiet, meaningful experience that lingers after the credits roll.",
            "From the first frame, The War Between Land and Sea makes one thing clear: peace is dead. The land stands proud—armies, kingdoms, steel, stone, ego. Humans build walls and call them forever. They draw borders and think nature will respect them.\nThe land fights back with earthquakes, collapsing cliffs, fire from beneath the ground. It roars. It resists. It bleeds. But the sea? The sea is eternal. Patient. Relentless.\n\nThis movie doesn’t give comfort. It gives humility.\n\nFinal verdict:\nThe War Between Land and Sea is a brutal, thunderous spectacle that reminds you of one truth: humanity doesn’t control nature—we survive at its mercy. Loud, dark, merciless, and unforgettable. 🌊🔥⚔️\nIf you're all about humanism and it's levels, definitely watch this 😊\nI'll rate this a 3.5 out of 5",
            "The BBC is busy creating bs series not finishing the tom Hardy series Taboo which was A success what are sick joke😭😭😭",
            "The performances ground the spectacle in emotion, giving weight to the chaos unfolding on screen. Characters are driven by fear, ambition, and the instinct to survive, making their decisions feel urgent and deeply personal. The direction maintains a firm grip on tension, ensuring the conflict never loses momentum.\nWhat sets War Between Land and Sea apart is its thematic depth. Beneath the action lies a powerful message about control, coexistence, and the cost of pushing nature beyond its limits. The film blends spectacle with meaning, turning large-scale conflict into a cautionary and compelling narrative.\nBy the final moments, War Between Land and Sea stands as a bold and immersive cinematic experience — intense, thought-provoking, and visually commanding. It earns its five-star rating as a powerful portrayal of conflict where the true enemy is imbalance itself.",
            "episode 1 and 2 are good then it went super crazy",
            "I love the thriller and I'm heading right away to search for the complete movie 🎉",
            "War Between Land and Sea is one of those movies where peace was never really an option. From the jump, you can tell it’s heading straight for chaos — kingdoms clashing, power struggles rising, and everybody convinced they’re right.\nThe story centers on a massive conflict between surface dwellers and underwater forces, each side fighting to protect what they believe belongs to them. Pride, revenge, and ancient grudges fuel the tension, turning small disagreements into full-blown war.\nVisually, the movie leans hard into spectacle. Ocean battles, powerful warriors, dramatic entrances, and enough destruction to keep you glued to the screen. When the fighting starts, it doesn’t hold back — land shakes, seas rage, and nobody escapes untouched.\nWhat makes it fun is the scale. This isn’t just personal beef; it’s armies versus armies, strategy versus strength, and leaders making choices that affect entire worlds. The action is intense, the stakes are high, and the drama is loud.\nIt may not reinvent storytelling, but it knows its assignment: deliver epic clashes and nonstop energy.\nIf you enjoy large-scale battles, mythic vibes, and stories where two worlds collide with no mercy, War Between Land and Sea brings the heat from both sides.",
            "The War Between Land and Sea is a powerful and emotionally charged movie that really makes you think. It’s not just about conflict or spectacle  it’s about survival, sacrifice, and the painful consequences of division. The storytelling feels raw and intentional, and the tension between both sides keeps you deeply invested from start to finish.\nOne part that truly stands out is the moment when characters from both land and sea are forced to confront the cost of the war on innocent lives. That scene hits hard because it shows that no side truly wins in a battle driven by pride and misunderstanding. It’s emotional, eye-opening, and unforgettable.\nIf you enjoy movies that combine action with deep meaning and strong emotional moments, this film is absolutely worth watching. It’s intense, thoughtful, and leaves a lasting impression long after it ends.",

It reflects not only the failures within systems of power, but also the collective responsibility of humanity itself.\n\nYes, not all leaders are corrupt. But this crisis goes beyond government alone. From land to sea, pollution is the result of human choices our lifestyles, our consumption, and the systems we tolerate. Governments, businesses, and large corporations may be the biggest contributors, but as ordinary citizens, we are not exempt from accountability.\n\nThis series challenged me to reflect on my own role.\nWhat choices am I making?\nHow can I contribute however small to healing rather than harming?\n\nReal change will not come from a “40-year plan” that keeps being postponed. Change must begin today in our homes, our communities, our work, and in the courage to demand better from those in power.\n\nMy hope is that governments, business leaders, and company owners will take responsibility, not just for profit, but for people and the planet. And my hope is also that we, as citizens, choose to act, speak, and live differently.\n\nThis is not just a battle between land and sea.\nIt is a battle for our shared future.\n\nMy heart cries… 😢\nBut it also believes change is still possible if we start now. 💚🌍",

The Mendez brothers’ story is moving at a snail’s pace… we’re halfway through and all we’ve got is them killing their parents, getting arrested, and repeating the same stories of abuse to lawyers and police.

Before their parents were murdered, they even robbed their neighbors, and it’s all on record. It seems like they were just entitled kids who wanted easy money and worldly riches, and thought they could get it by killing their parents.

Or something like Nikita or 12 Monkeys where they aren't parents, but agents crossing paths. Or heck, give them the leading roles in a Hallmark movie because I would kill to see them fall in love in a small town again. Or even just a cameo as a couple at a restaurant or a friend's parents.

As I immediately found it gripping it couldn't be spoiled by binge watching so I thought every evening I'd watch 1 episode of \"Emily in Rome\" that had just come out  and then 1 episode of \"Ripley\". Both series are set in Italy. Well, for \"Emily in Rome\", after the first two episodes I slugged through..to give it a chance because I had loved \"Emily in Paris\"... I proceeded to FAST FORWARD all the remaining episodes so it wouldn't be recommended to me again: this took about 50 seconds. I then proceeded to savour \"Ripley\". From Atrani to Venice, with Rome in between, the essence of Italy was truly captured, from the locals/working class to the aristocrats/well off society people. Even all the character actors with their tiny parts were superb, the reception staff? Perfect. Signorina Buffi, (the Landlady), perfect. LUCIO THE CAT? Honestly the best performance after Andrew Scott's!",

The music, the visuals, Dexter himself of course - perfect! It got better and better each episode. There was even one absolute \"Wtf 🤯!\" moment (related to the Gemini killer 😉). The only weak point for me was the Uma Thurman's character - too unatural and theatrical in my opinion. People in real life don't talk and act like that. She was a bit more human-like towards the end, after Dex had put some fear into her. I think if her character was more natural, the series would have been 11 out of 10.",

This goes back to having proper control of medication and how you can use it to repair a colony and or desist activity with it way before you have matters and issues. But that takes experience known as expertise. The party concept at this concept is not to have fun, it is to repair people in a colony by medicating them in a way that repairs.

While I thought The Batman movie was solid (as super hero movies go...) The Penguin is a whole different level. Even if you're not into super hero genre, or Batman, etc, this is closer to The Sopranos than Batman.

It’s looking more and more likely that most of us will have to stop paying for streaming as well. Brought to you by the same streaming service that cancelled Alex Ryder . 🙄☹️",

His character and storyline will have you experiencing emotional whiplash in the best ways that will keep you on edge about what will happen next. I also really liked how the show doesn't focus on the good vs evil perspective as much as the grey areas in between, adding layers to how you may feel towards a character.

And I loved it so much.\nOk, at first I maybe was a little annoyed how some of the characters personalities were changed but in the second half I just accepted the show as a different version of the story and I really enjoyed it this way. The last episode made me feel more emotions then the first two books together (because the books are lighter, and I mostly was really excited while reading them but never actually worried about anything or anyone, I mean, Murderbot kinda has a plot armor, correct me if I'm wrong (but please don't spoil anything from the book three and the next ones). \nBut here, I was literally on edge, because at some point, in the last episode, it gets serious and I wasn't ever sure if everyone in gonna be okay. I almost literally cried at some point, I can't imagine what I would feel if I had watched this before reading the books, not knowing anything about the plot. \nAlso, Gurathin is now my absolute favourite character and I want him to be hugged and protected from all of the bad stuff.

I don’t know what that has to do with medicine and it’s not just occasional. It’s takes over all of the shows to where person that’s not into that. Can’t even watch TV anymore.\nHas nothing to do with homophobia, but why can’t we just focus on the medical aspects of the shows? Why does everything have to be about homosexual relations? It’s just it gets so disgusting that you know they lose the storyline because it’s been half of the storyline on the people relations , which has nothing to do with the medical part of the show..\nNo, some of us just want to be able to watch a good show. I know Grey’s Anatomy was one of the first ones to go this way and quite frankly it’s a shame can’t watch Lonestar 911 now cannot watch this nice new show or this good new show . I mean the same thing with all the Chicago fire Chicago PD I know even Disney films they always have to have queers homosexuals and transvestites in them. I just go too far. You know some of us just wanna come home from work and watch a medical show about science and the ER And medical cases and we really don’t need to know about everybody’s relationship in the bedroom.

What sense does it make for them to compromise their clarity of mind?  All in the name of compassion? Foolish! Where are the real leaders at in the world?  Because it's becoming more “Lord of the Flys” on this doomed planet!",
            "The Importance of Clear Thinking\r\nWhen healthcare professionals take drugs or engage in any form of intoxication, even with the best intentions, they risk compromising their judgment and decision-making capabilities. Clarity of mind enables doctors to respond to emergencies, interpret medical data accurately, and execute treatment plans effectively.\r\n\r\nImagine a surgeon under the influence, where even a minor lapse in judgment could jeopardize a life. Or consider a therapist whose objectivity is clouded by emotional or psychological substances; they might misinterpret a patient's needs, leading them away from beneficial treatment pathways.\r\n\r\nThe trust placed in healthcare providers is immense, and it hinges on their ability to think clearly, make informed decisions, and act in the best interests of their patients. For patients, knowing their doctor is sober and focused is crucial not just for practical reasons, but also for the psychological assurance it provides.",
            "The world keeps BLINDLY and some times willingly going down the wrong path! And this show proves it.  I'm glad it got cancelled. A doctor experimenting with drugs?! Seriously people!  This is what you want! Do you have any common sense?!",
            "Potential Consequences of Impaired Judgement\r\nThe repercussions of a healthcare provider losing mental clarity due to substance use can range from mild to catastrophic. Subtle misjudgments in diagnosis might lead to inappropriate treatments, adversely impacting a patient's health. Moreover, the stigma attached to a doctor who uses drugs—even with altruistic motives—can erode the vital trust between patients and their healthcare providers.",
            "Empathy does not necessitate personal experience with drugs or illnesses. Instead, it can be cultivated through continued education, training, and mindfulness practices. Programs aimed at enhancing communication skills, understanding life experiences through shared narratives, and advocating for patient voices can create an environment where empathy thrives while maintaining professional integrity."

That is until the latest episode with Peter Dinledge. Good Grief why is that loser POS in this show? It's bad enough he's ruining the Dexter experience now he has to completely ruin this show as well?  The sad part is you're probably paying him more than Ethan Hawke because Ethan is a real has been he looks like a loser not just playing a loser but an actual loser like he's been doing meth or drinking huge quantities of alcohol for the last 10 years but he can still act.

But it has nothing to do with Anne Rice. \nThese don't feel like her characters, the vibes and aesthetics of the show do not carry anything over. \nIt lacks the detailed macabre romanticism of Anne Rice's works, The balance between empathy and monstrousness is not there. \nAnd I will say the main character feels like the dumbest smart person that I have watched in years. Frustratingly so. \n\nI do not hate this show, but if you are an Anne Rice fan any hint of her world building or aesthetic is simply not here. The show borrows names from her books It borrows some general outlines for characters. And that's it.",

Sometimes they run 3 Talamasca ads during the same break. It makes me NOT want to watch this show. (and I won't)."

At least 15-16. \nDrop 10 twice a year… every 6-7 months for 20 a year. That’s how you keep interest and build longevity. No one sticks around for any more than a season or 2 cuz no one wants to wait a year for a few episodes when content is always dropping. People move on and forget by time it comes around again. Most half hour comedies, especially buddy sitcoms and hang out comedies, rely on chemistry and a bond from the viewers. This doesn’t happen in 8 episodes… or 1+ year later for a batch of a few more episodes. \nThis is why it’s failing. Nothing sticks to long and this is why. \n\nIt explains why broadcast sitcoms still rule even today… everyone likes the 20-25 episodes a season. Those with 100+ episodes in all.

            "This movie was absolutely DISGUSTING. Beauty in Black is one of the lowest things Tyler Perry has ever put out. Every single chance he gets, he’s forcing the same tired narrative of homosexuality into the story, as if Black audiences can’t get through one of his films without being bombarded with it. It’s not art, it’s not empowering, it’s agenda-pushing — plain and simple.\nAnd don’t even get me started on the character Kimmie. Tyler Perry went out of his way to make her look like the worst kind of stereotype — low, dumb, and absolutely degrading as a Black woman. Instead of showing strength, class, or any depth, she’s written to be a joke. It’s insulting. Perry has made a career out of tearing down Black women on screen, and Kimmie is just the latest example of that mockery.\nHonestly, I walked away from this film feeling sick. There’s nothing “beautiful” about Beauty in Black. It’s messy, disrespectful, and a slap in the face to Black audiences who keep giving Tyler Perry the benefit of the doubt. At this point, he’s not even trying to uplift us — he’s exploiting us for views while recycling the same tired, toxic portrayals over and over.\nTyler Perry should be ashamed. This isn’t representation, it’s humiliation.",
